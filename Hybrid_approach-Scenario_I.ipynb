    "# Hybrid Approach -- Scenario I\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we report the code related to the *hybrid* appraoch in our paper [[1]](#ourpaper). We consider the delay caused by the feedback loop used by the mobile user equipment to send to the base station the channel state information (CSI). Due to this feedback delay, the CSI available at the base station becomes outdated. In our paper, we propose a hybrid *data-driven* and *model-based* approach. The model-based part consists of using a FIR Wiener filter to predict the instantaneous CSI given the channel history, which we assume available at the base station. The data-driven part consists of a neural network whose input is the output of the Wiener filter. Ths network maps the CSI to the probability of an error event for all the MCSs and selects the MCS that maximizes the spectral efficiency.\n",

    "*Overall hybrid approach. The past channel history $\\boldsymbol{\\psi}$ is used to optimally estimate, via Wiener filter, the channel in effect at transmission time. Then, the estimate $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{h}}$ is mapped by the Fully Connected Neural Network to the corresponding set of conditional error event probabilities, i.e., $\\hat{\\rho}_1,...,\\hat{\\rho}_K$, for each MCS available at the BS. The final step is the selection of the MCS which gives the maximum expected spectral efficiency.Each layer of the neural network is parameterized by a weight matrix $\\boldsymbol{W}$ and a bias vector $\\boldsymbol{b}$ such that the output of the $i^{th}$ layer, i.e., $\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}^{(i)}$, is given by $\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}^{(i)}=\\Phi^{(i)} ( \\boldsymbol{W}^{(i)}\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}^{(i-1)} + \\boldsymbol{b}^{(i)} )$ where $D_{i}$ is the dimension of the $i^{th}$ layer, where $\\Phi$ is a non-linear activation function applied element-wise, where $\\boldsymbol{W}^{(i)} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{D_{i}\\mathrm{x}(D_{i-1})}$ and where $\\boldsymbol{b} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{D_{i}}$.*\n",
